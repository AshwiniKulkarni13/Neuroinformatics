histogram(Power(1,:))
histogram(Power(2,:))
x = Power(1,:);
y = Power(2,:);
[h,p] = ttest(x,y) 

% h = 1 implies that the null hypothesis failed cearly stating that there
% is significance difference in the two sets of data;
%p = 0.0434 implies that difference is significant as it is less than 0.05
